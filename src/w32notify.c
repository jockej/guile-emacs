   Design overview:

   For each watch request, we launch a separate worker thread.  The
   worker thread runs the watch_worker function, which issues an
   asynchronous call to ReadDirectoryChangesW, and then waits in
   SleepEx for that call to complete.  Waiting in SleepEx puts the
   thread in an "alertable" state, so it wakes up when either (a) the
   call to ReadDirectoryChangesW completes, or (b) the main thread
   instructs the worker thread to terminate by sending it an APC, see
   below.

   When the ReadDirectoryChangesW call completes, its completion
   routine watch_completion is automatically called.  watch_completion
   stashes the received file events in a buffer used to communicate
   them to the main thread (using a critical section, so that several
   threads could use the same buffer), posts a special message,
   WM_EMACS_FILENOTIFY, to the Emacs's message queue, and returns.
   That causes the SleepEx function call inside watch_worker to
   return, and watch_worker then issues another call to
   ReadDirectoryChangesW.  (Except when it does not, see below.)

   In a GUI session, the WM_EMACS_FILENOTIFY message posted to the
   message queue gets dispatched to the main Emacs window procedure,
   which queues it for processing by w32_read_socket.  When
   w32_read_socket sees this message, it accesses the buffer with file
   notifications (using a critical section), extracts the information,
   converts it to a series of FILE_NOTIFY_EVENT events, and stuffs
   them into the input event queue to be processed by keyboard.c input
   machinery (read_char via a call to kbd_buffer_get_event).

   In a non-GUI session, we send the WM_EMACS_FILENOTIFY message to
   the main (a.k.a. "Lisp") thread instead, since there are no window
   procedures in console programs.  That message wakes up
   MsgWaitForMultipleObjects inside sys_select, which then signals to
   its caller that some keyboard input is available.  This causes
   w32_console_read_socket to be called, which accesses the buffer
   with file notifications and stuffs them into the input event queue
   for keyboard.c to process.

   When the FILE_NOTIFY_EVENT event is processed by keyboard.c's
   kbd_buffer_get_event, it is converted to a Lispy event that can be
   bound to a command.  The default binding is file-notify-handle-event,
   defined on subr.el.

   After w32_read_socket or w32_console_read_socket are done
   processing the notifications, they reset a flag signaling to all
   watch worker threads that the notifications buffer is available for
   more input.

   When the watch is removed by a call to w32notify-rm-watch, the main
   thread requests that the worker thread terminates by queuing an APC
   for the worker thread.  The APC specifies the watch_end function to
   be called.  watch_end calls CancelIo on the outstanding
   ReadDirectoryChangesW call and closes the handle on which the
   watched directory was open.  When watch_end returns, the
   watch_completion function is called one last time with the
   ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED status, which causes it to clean up and set
   a flag telling watch_worker to exit without issuing another
   ReadDirectoryChangesW call.  Since watch_worker is the thread
   procedure of the worker thread, exiting it causes the thread to
   exit.  The main thread waits for some time for the worker thread to
   exit, and if it doesn't, terminates it forcibly.  */

This arranges for filesystem events pertaining to FILE to be reported
to Emacs.  Use `w32notify-rm-watch' to cancel the watch.

Value is a descriptor for the added watch.  If the file cannot be
watched for some reason, this function signals a `file-error' error.

FILTER is a list of conditions for reporting an event.  It can include
the following symbols:

  'file-name'          -- report file creation, deletion, or renaming
  'directory-name'     -- report directory creation, deletion, or renaming
  'attributes'         -- report changes in attributes
  'size'               -- report changes in file-size
  'last-write-time'    -- report changes in last-write time
  'last-access-time'   -- report changes in last-access time
  'creation-time'      -- report changes in creation time
  'security-desc'      -- report changes in security descriptor

If FILE is a directory, and FILTER includes 'subtree', then all the
subdirectories will also be watched and changes in them reported.

When any event happens that satisfies the conditions specified by
FILTER, Emacs will call the CALLBACK function passing it a single
argument EVENT, which is of the form

  (DESCRIPTOR ACTION FILE)

DESCRIPTOR is the same object as the one returned by this function.
ACTION is the description of the event.  It could be any one of the
following:

  'added'        -- FILE was added
  'removed'      -- FILE was deleted
  'modified'     -- FILE's contents or its attributes were modified
  'renamed-from' -- a file was renamed whose old name was FILE
  'renamed-to'   -- a file was renamed and its new name is FILE

FILE is the name of the file whose event is being reported.

Note that some networked filesystems, such as Samba-mounted Unix
volumes, might not send notifications about file changes.  In these
cases, this function will return a valid descriptor, but notifications
will never come in.  Volumes shared from remote Windows machines do
generate notifications correctly, though.  */)
